# Day 15 ‚Äì Install and Configure Nginx with SSL on App Server 2 (xFusionCorp)

## üîß Task

The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries needs to prepare App Server 2 for a new application deployment.

**Requirements:**

1. Install and configure **nginx** on App Server 2.
2. Move the self-signed SSL certificate and key from `/tmp/nautilus.crt` and `/tmp/nautilus.key` to an appropriate location (`/etc/nginx/ssl/`).
3. Configure Nginx to use the SSL cert and key.
4. Create an `index.html` file under Nginx document root with content `Welcome!`.
5. Verify by accessing App Server 2 from the jumphost:
   ```bash
   curl -Ik https://stapp02
   ```
