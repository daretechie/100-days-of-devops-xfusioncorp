# Day 26 – Update Git Remote and Push Changes (xFusionCorp)

## 🔧 Task

The development team made updates to the project under `/opt/games.git`, cloned at `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/games`. The DevOps team recently added new Git remotes. We need to update the local repo as follows:

**Requirements:**

1. In `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/games` repo, add a new remote `dev_games` and point it to `/opt/xfusioncorp_games.git`.
2. Copy the `/tmp/index.html` file into the repo and add/commit it to the **master** branch.
3. Push the **master** branch to the new `dev_games` remote.

## 🖥️ Target Server

- Hostname: ststor01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
- Path: `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/games`

## 📌 Notes

The goal is to make sure the new `dev_games` remote is properly set up and synced with the latest changes.
