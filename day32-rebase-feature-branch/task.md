# Day 32 – Rebase Feature Branch with Master (xFusionCorp)

## 🔧 Task

The Nautilus development team has a repository `/opt/official.git` cloned at `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos`.

A developer is working on the **feature branch** (still in progress). Meanwhile, changes have been pushed to the **master branch**.

The requirement:

- Rebase the `feature` branch with the `master` branch.
- Do not lose any changes from `feature`.
- Do not introduce merge commits (so **no merge**, only rebase).
- Push the updated branch to origin.

---

## 🖥️ Target Server

- Hostname: ststor01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
- Path to repo: `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/official`

---

## 📌 Notes

- Rebasing rewrites history but keeps a linear commit log.
- No merge commit should appear in `feature`.

```

```
