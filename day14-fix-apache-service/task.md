# Day 14 – Fix Apache Service Availability (xFusionCorp)

## 🔧 Task

The production support team reported Apache service unavailability on one of the app servers.  
We need to:

- Identify the faulty app host.
- Ensure Apache service is running on **all app servers**.
- Configure Apache to listen on port **8082** everywhere.

## 🖥️ Target Servers

- stapp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
- stapp02.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
- stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
- User: tony/steve/banner
- Password: respective Nautilus passwords

## 📌 Notes

The servers might not host code yet, so pages may be blank. What matters is Apache is **running and bound to port 8082**.
